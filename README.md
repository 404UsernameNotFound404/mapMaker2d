# mapMaker2d
Creats a 2d array of 1's or 0's forming a map. There are two algorithms I implemented resursive backtracking, and hunt and kill.
To change between them there is a boolean inside index.js inside the folder src. In that file there is a boolean called huntAndKill
to see the hunt and kill agorithim make said boolean true.
